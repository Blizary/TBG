  mainText: "Old Steve live far away in the country, when he was young, he had been
    to the city and had engaged in a period of manual Labour. Because he works hard
    and has no bad habits so he amassed some property -- some cash, he loved this
    cute little thing. He was not usually willing to spend money, nor did he trust
    to deposit it in the bank and let some other people to keep for him. \r\nIn order
    to save money, he lived in the most humble environment, ate only the cheapest
    food, never drank, and lived like an ascetic; but in his eyes, it was all worth
    it. Eventually, Steve returned to the countryside with his hard-earned savings,
    because he always felt that he did not belong in the big city, even though he
    had worked there for several years. \r\nIn the city, changes happen so fast, new
    things appear faster than he can accept, which makes him feel very uncomfortable.
    After he decided to go back to his hometown, he bought what he considered decent
    clothes, a less expensive pipe -- even though he had never smoked before, and
    a radio, the most expensive he had ever spent as long as he could remember. \r\nWhen
    he came back down, he seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. Everything was still
    familiar, almost the same as it had been when he had left years before. Steve
    was satisfied with that, he hated changes. He thought he might live out his life
    like this, simply but more dignified than the rest of the village, that's enough.
    In this way, in the changeless days, Steve gradually became the old Steve.\r\n"
