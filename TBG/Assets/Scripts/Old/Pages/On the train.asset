  mainText: "Old Steve get on the train to a big city, he wondered why 'cash' suddenly
    wasn't 'money' anymore, why people stopped using these cute bills and replaced
    them with something else...\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWatching the familiar landscape fly
    by outside, Steve recalled how the village looked when he was a boy. When he left
    to work in the city, the village was the same;He came back after years of working
    in the city, and the village looked the same;Now that he is old, nothing has changed
    here.He could not help thinking how much better it would be if the world were
    static, and why there were always so many new changes, and he coughed again under
    his breath.\r\n"
